Example: instead of “Clean up” say “Pick up all of your building blocks.”\n- Consider your child’s age and abilities—make sure they can actually do what you ask.\n- Teach your child how to follow daily routines by breaking them down into small steps.\n- Routines can be short (washing hands before dinner) or longer (bedtime routine).\n- Only introduce one new rule or routine at a time.\n- When following a routine, give one instruction at a time. Keep them simple!\n- Make sure your child follows through with each instruction.\n- Praise your child immediately after following your instructions.\n\n**Be Consistent** \n- Follow rules and routines daily so your child knows what to expect.\n- Use transition warnings before the beginning of a daily routine.: Example: “In 5 minutes, it will be bedtime, Sarah.”\n- Use simple incentives to encourage your child.\n- Get help from your spouse or family when needed.\n- Create a calm environment for your child during routines, especially bedtime.\n- Over time, your child will follow routines more independently."

Example: instead of “Clean up” say “Pick up all of your building blocks.”\n- Consider your child’s age and abilities—make sure they can actually do what you ask.\n- Teach your child how to follow daily routines by breaking them down into small steps.\n- Routines can be short (washing hands before dinner) or longer (bedtime routine).\n- Only introduce one new rule or routine at a time.\n- When following a routine, give one instruction at a time. Keep them simple!\n- Make sure your child follows through with each instruction.\n- Praise your child immediately after following your instructions.\n\n**Be Consistent** \n- Follow rules and routines daily so your child knows what to expect.\n- Use transition warnings before the beginning of a daily routine.: Example: “In 5 minutes, it will be bedtime, Sarah.”\n- Use simple incentives to encourage your child.\n- Get help from your spouse or family when needed.\n- Create a calm environment for your child during routines, especially bedtime.\n- Over time, your child will follow routines more independently.",
