Mobile network charges: Using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, will mean that your terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.\n\n3. Third-party information: Although we endeavour to ensure that the app is updated and its content accurate, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. We do not regularly review all of the external sites and cannot guarantee that they are always accurate or reliable.\n\n4. Limitation of liability: The @global.app_name team accepts no liability for any damage or loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of using the app, or arising from any reliance you may place on advice or information provided from the app. You should always exercise your own discretion and judgement appropriate to your own circumstances in relation to any advice or information provided from the app.\n\n5. Viruses and bugs: Any instances of software bugs, viruses or other malicious material transmitted by a third party through our site are a regret, but we are devoid of responsibility.\n\n6. App updates: The app is regularly updated to improve performance and content. The system requirements for the app may change over time, depending on the platform you use (and any additional platforms we may support in the future). It is your responsibility to download updates to continue using the app. The @global.app_name team does not guarantee that the app will always be updated to remain compatible with your device’s operating system. However, you agree to accept any updates to the app when they are offered to you.\n\n7. Availability and termination: The app site might not be available at all times for reasons of maintenance or trouble with associated software or hardware. Whilst we apologise for inconveniences, we are not liable for any loss you may incur should the site not be accessible or is withdrawn. Equally, we have the right and choice to terminate your access and use of the app (including availability of captured data) at any time, without warning.
