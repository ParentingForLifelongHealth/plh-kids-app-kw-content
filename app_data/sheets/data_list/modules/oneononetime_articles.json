Let things go at your child’s pace. Try to give them time to explore and be patient. \n- You can watch your child play or you can try different activities together.\n\n**Use words to describe what your child is doing**\n- Use words to describe actions, colours, shapes, numbers, sizes, textures, temperatures, tastes, sounds, and anything else that is happening! \n- Your child will learn a lot from what you say and do. \n\n**Praise** \n- Remember this is the child's game. Can you think how you have felt recently when someone has been critical of you? \n- There is no right or wrong in play, and within reason, what your child chooses to play is right for them. \n- Your job is to show an interest and say something nice.\n\n**Give as few instructions or directions as possible.**\n- Of course, you have to take action if your child does something that he or she is not allowed to do, such as ignoring an agreed house rule, or wants to do something dangerous (like playing with matches)\n-However, generally when you are spending one-on-one time with your child, s/he or she should lead the activity. \n- Also, try not to ask questions. \n\n**Give just enough help so it feels like their achievement.**\n- Play alongside and copy what they are doing but try to let them keep the initiative. \n- If they ask what to do, turn the question back by asking what they could do or think that they might do next. \n- For children who do not have self-confidence, it is particularly important that they do not get directions from adults all the time.\n\n**You are in charge**\n- You must decide when the session finishes. \n- Give your child a “Transition Warning” when there is one minute remaining in one-on-one time.",

Let things go at your child’s pace. Try to give them time to explore and be patient. \n- You can watch your child play or you can try different activities together.\n\n**Use words to describe what your child is doing**\n- Use words to describe actions, colours, shapes, numbers, sizes, textures, temperatures, tastes, sounds, and anything else that is happening! \n- Your child will learn a lot from what you say and do. \n\n**Praise** \n- Remember this is the child's game. Can you think how you have felt recently when someone has been critical of you? \n- There is no right or wrong in play, and within reason, what your child chooses to play is right for them. \n- Your job is to show an interest and say something nice.\n\n**Give as few instructions or directions as possible.**\n- Of course, you have to take action if your child does something that he or she is not allowed to do, such as ignoring an agreed house rule, or wants to do something dangerous (like playing with matches)\n-However, generally when you are spending one-on-one time with your child, s/he or she should lead the activity. \n- Also, try not to ask questions. \n\n**Give just enough help so it feels like their achievement.**\n- Play alongside and copy what they are doing but try to let them keep the initiative. \n- If they ask what to do, turn the question back by asking what they could do or think that they might do next. \n- For children who do not have self-confidence, it is particularly important that they do not get directions from adults all the time.\n\n**You are in charge**\n- You must decide when the session finishes. \n- Give your child a “Transition Warning” when there is one minute remaining in one-on-one time."
